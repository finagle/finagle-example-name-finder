= Finagle Essentials

Author: link:https://twitter.com/travisbrown[@travisbrown]

== Introduction

* What we're doing
* How we'll do it
* Getting set up

=== Goals

* Learn to think in terms of Finagle's core abstractions
* Develop a deeper understanding of link:https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/#com.twitter.util.Try[+Try+] and link:https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/#com.twitter.util.Future[+Future+]
* Learn how to write a Thrift IDL and generate bindings with link:http://twitter.github.io/scrooge/[Scrooge]
* Understand the challenges of working with blocking code in the context of Finagle

=== Approach

* This is a hands-on lab!
* Some slides, lots of code, some whiteboard
* Follow along in the Scala REPL
* Interrupt with questions at any time

=== Getting started

What you need

* Git
* Java

Cloning the project

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/finagle/finagle-name-finder.git
----

Downloading the models (more about this soon)

[source,bash]
----
cd names
sh download-models.sh
----

=== Useful links

* link:https://github.com/finagle/finagle-name-finder[This project]
* link:https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/index.html#package[Twitter Util API docs]
* link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/index.html#package[Finagle API docs]
* link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Quickstart.html[Finagle quickstart]

=== Build system

Note: we'll use link:http://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT] today

* This is almost entirely irrelevant!
* This is not a course about build tools
* You could also use link:http://pantsbuild.github.io/[Pants]

=== What's a REPL?

* REPL == "Read Eval Print Loop"
* SBT runner is included here, and you can start it with +./sbt+
* From the SBT console, +console+ will open a REPL
* That's (almost) all you need to know about SBT

=== What should it look like?

[source,bash]

== Named-entity recognition

=== Our example project

* Start with a Java library that finds names in text
* Wrap it in an idiomatic Scala API
* Expose its functionality as a Finagle service

=== What is named-entity recognition?

Kinds of "names" commonly recognized

* [red]#People#
* [blue]#Places#
* [fuchsia]#Organizations#
* [green]#Monetary values#

=== Example input

On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services.

=== Example output

On account of the bequest of the late [red]#Ezekiah Hopkins#, of [blue]#Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.#, there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the [fuchsia]#League# to a salary of [green]#£4# a week for purely nominal services.

=== Pipeline

image::images/ner_pipeline.png[Named entity recognition pipeline]

=== OpenNLP

* Java link:https://opennlp.apache.org/[Natural language processing library] providing NER
* Not as accurate out of the box as e.g. link:http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml[Stanford NLP], but...
* Apache License, version 2.0
* Easy to train new models for specific domains

=== Example usage

[source,scala]
----
val sentDetector = new SentenceDetectorME(new SentenceModel(sdStream))
val tokenizer = new TokenizerME(new TokenizerModel(tokStream))
val finder = new NameFinderME(new TokenNameFinderModel(nfStream))

val sentences = sentDetector.sentDetect(document)
val tokenized = sentences map { s => tokenizer.tokenize(s) }
val nameSpans: Seq[String] = tokenized map { tokens =>
  Span.spansToStrings(finder.find(tokens), tokens)
}

finder.clearAdaptiveData()
----

=== Limitations of the API in this context

* Lots of methods throw exceptions
* Processing is synchronous
* Not thread-safe

[source,scala]
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The span [268..276) is outside
  the given text which has length 155!
----

=== Goal for our example project

* Handle errors gracefully
* Scale to take advantage of multiple processors
* Scale to take advantage of multiple machines

== Writing a Scala wrapper

=== Handling errors with exceptions

[source,scala]
----
def parseAndIncrement(input: String): Int = input.toInt + 1
----

=== Modeling failure as a value

[source,scala]
----
def parseAndIncrement(input: String): Try[Int] =
  Try { input.toInt } map { i => i + 1 }
----

=== Chaining computations that may fail

[source,scala]
----
def safeDivide(n: Int, d: Int): Try[Int] = Try { n / d }

val good = for {
  n <- parseAndIncrement("5")
  d <- parseAndIncrement("1")
  result <- safeDivide(n, d)
} yield result

val bad1 = for {
  n <- parseAndIncrement("5")
  d <- parseAndIncrement("-1")
  result <- safeDivide(n, d)
} yield result

val bad2 = for {
  n <- parseAndIncrement("v")
  d <- parseAndIncrement("1")
  result <- safeDivide(n, d)
} yield result
----

=== Desugaring

[source,scala]
----
val good = for {
  n <- parseAndIncrement("5")
  d <- parseAndIncrement("1")
  result <- safeDivide(n, d)
} yield result

val sugarFreeGood = parseAndIncrement("5") flatMap { n =>
  parseAndIncrement("1") flatMap { d =>
    safeDivide(n, d)
  }
}
----

=== Other methods

[source,scala]
----
val tries = Seq("1", "2", "3") map parseAndIncrement

Try.collect(tries)

bad2 getOrElse 0

bad2 rescue {
  case t: NumberFormatException => com.twitter.util.Return(0)
}
----

=== Relationship to +Option+ and +Either+

* +Option+: container of one or zero elements
* +Either+: one of two types of things
* +Try+: container of one element or an exception

=== +Try+ in the Scala standard library

* Semantically (almost) identical
* Some of the names are different

=== Testing with ScalaTest

* Using +FunSuite+, +assert+, and +===+

== Introduction to Finagle

=== Core abstractions

* Futures
* Services
* Servers
* Clients
* Filters

=== Futures

Like +Try+, but with an extra state

* Not yet completed
* Failed
* Successfully completed (or "satisfied")

=== Futures, try, etc.

image::images/types.png[Types]

=== Future combinators

Like +Try+, can be combined using +map+, +flatMap+, +handle+, +rescue+, etc.

Also allows registration of callbacks:

* +onSuccess(f: A => Unit)+
* +onFailure(ex: Throwable => Unit)+

More about the when and where of where futures run later

=== Services

A service is a function

[source,scala]
----
class Service[-Req, +Rep] extends (Req => Future[Rep])
----

* +Try+ models failure as a value
* +Future+ models both failure and delay as a value

=== What services aren't

* The service API doesn't know anything about the network

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.finagle.Service
import com.twitter.util.Future

val parserService = new Service[String, Int] {
  def apply(request: String) = Future(request.toInt)
}
----

=== Servers

Servers make services available on the network over a protocol

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.finagle.Http

val myHttpService: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = ???

val server = Http.serve(":8080", myHttpService)
----

* +Http+ is a +Server[HttpRequest, HttpResponse]+
* +server+ is a +ListeningServer+

=== Clients

The term "client" is overloaded

* The link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.Client[+Client+] interface creates "clients" (in the second sense) for a specific protocol
* A "materialized client" is a link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.ServiceFactory[+ServiceFactory+]
* In some cases the +Services+ created by a +ServiceFactory+ are called "clients"
* Instances of Scrooge's +ThriftService+ are often called "clients"

=== Example: HTTP client

A client in our third sense

[source,scala]
----
val client: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] =
  Http.newService("www.google.com:80")
----

=== Filters

Filters have a complicated-looking type:

[source,scala]
----
class Filter[-ReqIn, +RepOut, +ReqOut, -RepIn]
  extends (ReqIn, Service[ReqOut, RepIn]) => Future[RepOut]
----

Filters are actually relatively simple: they're just service transformers

=== Timeout filter

link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.service.TimeoutFilter[+TimeoutFilter+] is an example of a link:https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/SimpleFilter.html[+SimpleFilter+] (doesn't change types)

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.conversions.time._
import com.twitter.finagle.util.DefaultTimer
import com.twitter.finagle.service.TimeoutFilter

val myTimeoutFilter =
  new TimeoutFilter[String, Int](1.second, DefaultTimer.twitter)
----

=== Using a timeout filter

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.util.FuturePool

val slowParserService = new Service[String, Int] {
  def apply(request: String) = FuturePool.unboundedPool {
    Thread.sleep(5000); request.toInt
  }
}

val myService = myTimeoutFilter andThen slowParserService
----

=== Protocols

Finagle is designed to make it possible to define many components in a protocol-agnostic fashion

* We'll be building servers and clients that speak the Thrift protocol today
* The Finagle link:http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Quickstart.html[Quickstart] gives an HTTP example
* Other supported protocols include Redis, Protobuf, MySQL, SMTP, ZooKeeper, etc.

== Thrift and Scrooge

* The link:https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl[Thrift interface description language] allows us to define data types and service interfaces
* Bindings for specific languages are created using code generation tools
* We'll be using Twitter's link:http://twitter.github.io/scrooge/[Scrooge] via an SBT plugin

=== Where's the code?

* Generated automatically when we compile with +sbt compile+
* Lives in +target/scala-2.10/src_managed/main+

=== Implementing the Scrooge interfaces

We need to define a method implementation for every function in our service

== More about futures

* When and where do they run?
* How can we control that?
* How are they different from the futures in the standard library?

=== Pop quiz

When do these return?

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.util.Future

val f1 = Future { Thread.sleep(5000) }
val f2 = Future { 0 } map { _ => Thread.sleep(5000) }
val f3 = Future.value(Thread.sleep(5000))
val f4 = for {
  a <- Future { 1 }
  b <- Future { Thread.sleep(5000); 2 }
} yield a + b
----

=== Extra credit

When do these return?

[source,scala]
----
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val f1 = Future { Thread.sleep(5000) }
val f2 = Future { 0 } map { _ => Thread.sleep(5000) }
val f3 = Future.successful(Thread.sleep(5000))
val f4 = for {
  a <- Future { 1 }
  b <- Future { Thread.sleep(5000); 2 }
} yield a + b
----

=== From the quickstart

[source,scala]
----
val service = new Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] {
  def apply(req: HttpRequest): Future[HttpResponse] =
    Future.value(new DefaultHttpResponse(
      req.getProtocolVersion, HttpResponseStatus.OK))
}
----

We need to be careful with I/O, since +Future.value+ blocks a Finagle thread

=== Future pools

[source,scala]
----
import com.twitter.util.FuturePool

val pool = FuturePool.unboundedPool

val f1 = pool { Thread.sleep(5000); 0 }
val f2 = pool { 0 } map expensiveOp
----

== Putting it all together

=== A bad solution

What's wrong with +NaiveNameRecognizerService+?

(Hint: there's more than one thing)

=== A better solution

* Use a future pool to keep Finagle threads free when we're doing IO
* Use resource pools to control access to our non-thread-safe objects

== twitter-server

link:http://twitter.github.io/twitter-server/index.html[twitter-server]: an alternative +App+

* Flags for configuration
* Logging and metrics
* Admin HTTP interface
* Lifecycle management endpoints for e.g. Mesos's job manager

=== Using twitter-server

[source,bash]
----
./sbt run
----
